*Include: Muss, Kann, Abgrenzungen*

## Ziele:

* Generate an artificial data set with affecting factors on blood sugar (e.g. eating, activity, insulin application)
* Build an example model to test and better understand the most important characteristics of a time series model, e.g. sequence size, window length, prediction length, layer architecture (stacking, features, etc.)
* Finalise semester goals (Muss, Kann, Abgrenzungen)

## Geschafft

## In Arbeit

* Rachael: working on an example model. I believe the model itself is fine (it's very simple), but I'm still working out the bugs in looping the predictions and plotting the results.
